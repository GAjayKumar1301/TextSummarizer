AI-Powered Text Summarizer
This project is a simple, yet powerful, web-based text summarizer that leverages the Google Gemini API to condense long articles, documents, or any text into a concise summary. Built with a clean, responsive user interface using Tailwind CSS, this application provides a seamless and intuitive experience for users who need to quickly grasp the main points of a text.

Features:
Instant Summarization: Get a summary of your text in seconds by simply pasting it into the text area and clicking the "Summarize Text" button.

Gemini API Integration: Utilizes the advanced natural language processing capabilities of Google's Gemini-2.0-flash model for accurate and relevant summaries.

Responsive Design: The user interface is built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean and responsive layout that works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.

Loading Indicator: Provides a clear loading animation to indicate that the summarization process is in progress, enhancing the user experience.

Error Handling: Includes basic validation and error handling to inform the user of potential issues, such as an empty input or a failed API request.

How It Works:
The application's core functionality is powered by client-side JavaScript. When the "Summarize Text" button is clicked, the script performs the following steps:

It retrieves the text from the input area.

It constructs a prompt for the Gemini API, requesting a concise summary of the provided text.

It makes an asynchronous fetch request to the Google Gemini API endpoint, sending the prompt and the API key.

It processes the API response, extracts the generated summary, and displays it in the output area.

In case of an error, it displays a user-friendly error message.

This project serves as an excellent example of how to integrate a powerful AI model like Gemini into a web application to create a useful and practical tool.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For the structure of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
